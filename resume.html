                    <p id="education-body"> From the start of my college career - I knew I had wanted to be a designer. I watched my peers as they
                    changed their majors, their dreams, but I stood by mine.
                    When I got to my junior year I started realizing that I had a passion for user experience and user interface. 
                    I took every project I could, and made it about UX and UI. Being part of the Glyphix team 
                    (VCD's student run design studio) opened my eyes to working with clients, the good, bad and in-between. I did absolutely love being
                    able to see the client so happy at a logo design I had personally lead! During the last two  
                    years of undergrad, I aspired to be more well rounded, and worked a lot on my illustration 
                    skills (though it wasn't until after I graduated that I got really comfortable exploring that interest more)
                    My undergrad education was probably one of the best parts of my life thus far - I always wanted to learn new things, work with more people,
                    and build connections with others. Now that I'm out of school I'm focusing on moving my career towards being a product designer, though 
                    thoughts of grad school are always in the back of my mind!</p>

               of the job was proofing + making sure all the prices were right. While this was the main source of income for 
               the company when I started, the creative department (two of my peers that I went to school with) was branching
               out to create custom banners and signage for the grocery stores we worked with. Now this is where my coworkers
               bestowed on me wisdom for large format printing. I ended up making quite a few in-store signs and designed
               the rewards program cards and programs for a local grocery store. I really felt like I learned more about how

          <h7 id="employer-yellow">Vividfront</h7>
          <p id="experience-body">As a brand-new graduate, I was really excited to accept a full-time paying
          internship. I spent a lot of time in the car listening to my daily podcasts, since it was a long commute for me.
          I wasn't too familiar with the world of marketing - other than the basics. I was in for 
          a new world of suprises and challenges with designing for companies for marketing purposes.
          It's definitely a field that is very precise as far as production is concerned. I absorbed as much
          information on the technical aspect of creating banner ads, ads for Amazon, and social media posts. The biggest challenge I had in 
          this position were the many clashing personalities I had with the marketing department, and my other designers.
          I never really felt like I was apart of the team, that was a big part of the decision I made that the position
          wasn't for me. That was a really big learning experience for me - when you know you don't fit into the culture.

          get this next job at American Greetings! A few of the peers I had from college worked in my department as well.
          The training for this particular job was 2 weeks long: we  went over all of the technical aspects of producing
          a greeting card for print, learning all the different types of glitter (the best part), paper color, and attachments 
          that are added to the card. I had a pretty good understanding of print from my previous internship, but this 
          was so intricate! Ultimately this was very production oriented but helped me get more skills in print.

               of roles in this current job. I like to be able to expand and move around to help with things as needed. 
               The best part of this job is all of the different clients and projects we work on. It also helps that 
               the team is basically one big family, minus all of the drama. I've designed anything from a 300-page 
               employee manual to interactive sexual harrassment training. Ultimately, I know that I'm making the 
               learning experience better for employees who want to improve their skills. I put a lot of pride into my
